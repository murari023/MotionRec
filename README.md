# MotionRec
This repository contains a Keras implementation of the paper 'MotionRec: A Unified Deep Framework for Moving Object Recognition' accepted in WACV 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first attempt for simultaneous localization and classification of moving objects in a video, i.e. moving object recognition (MOR) in a single-stage deep learning framework.

(Code and annotated dataset will be uploaded soon)
